# Readme
In this challenge, I'll create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. As you code, I'll gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the Document Object Model's power, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.
